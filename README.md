# /vn/ Moege Chart

## Ideas/TODOs

-   Add a VN counter somewhere to show how many VNs fit under the current set of filters
-   Automatically sort all VNs by GenreFocus so chartanon doesn't have to manually place each new VN in the correct area
-   Colourize moenukige in the faq to have the white text-shadow

## Working Area

### Posts to use/draw inspiration from for the newcomer recommendation/babby's first descriptions

If you want my opinion any smee or any yuzusoft VN should be marked as a good starter, this goes both ways. I can't imagine someone enjoying moege and not liking what yuzusoft or smee has to offer on the other hand if your first vn is from yuzusoft and you don't like it it's a clear indication you will not enjoy other moege.

Making Lovers is a really good choice. Mega-popular, the fandisc is translated so if they instantly want more they aren't told to wait, it has an actual series now so it will continue being relevant, the pacing is fast and you start dating a girl very quickly and then start having sex quickly too because the characters are adults and not school kids, and the characters being adults also means it's less squicky to normies that aren't ready for lolifucking in their 1st VN, and the comedy and romance are both very well done, and the game generates lots of discussion even to this day so if a newfag comes to /vn/ and says "I really liked Ako, what other games have characters like her" there will be plenty of people able to rec based on that instantly.

Princess Evangile because it has cool action and interesting drama while still being a pure moege. It's got enough of a hook to get people interested in both plotge and moege. Senren Banka, Dracu Riot, and Noble Works are also good choices.
