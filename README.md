# /vn/ Moege Chart

## Ideas/TODOs

-   Add a VN counter somewhere to show how many VNs fit under the current set of filters
-   Add localstorage to save filter settings/other stuff

## Working Area

### Posts to use/draw inspiration from for the newcomer recommendation/babby's first descriptions

If you want my opinion any smee or any yuzusoft VN should be marked as a good starter, this goes both ways. I can't imagine someone enjoying moege and not liking what yuzusoft or smee has to offer on the other hand if your first vn is from yuzusoft and you don't like it it's a clear indication you will not enjoy other moege.

Making Lovers is a really good choice. Mega-popular, the fandisc is translated so if they instantly want more they aren't told to wait, it has an actual series now so it will continue being relevant, the pacing is fast and you start dating a girl very quickly and then start having sex quickly too because the characters are adults and not school kids, and the characters being adults also means it's less squicky to normies that aren't ready for lolifucking in their 1st VN, and the comedy and romance are both very well done, and the game generates lots of discussion even to this day so if a newfag comes to /vn/ and says "I really liked Ako, what other games have characters like her" there will be plenty of people able to rec based on that instantly.

Princess Evangile because it has cool action and interesting drama while still being a pure moege. It's got enough of a hook to get people interested in both plotge and moege. Senren Banka, Dracu Riot, and Noble Works are also good choices.

Majikoi
It has lots of choices, a good cast of core heroines and bro characters, it's lengthy so a newcomer can sink their teeth into the genre properly, has a plethora of fandisks and a sequel they can also read and the vast majority of characters have sprites and are voiced.
- The problem with this is that Majikoi isn't typical moege at all. It has real drama, lots of real fight scenes, and actual plot.
If this is someone's 1st game they will be under the wrong impression of the genre. It would be a shame if someone that would love moege picks up Majikoi because it's promoted as a good 1st choice, and then they come to the conclusion they don't like moege if they don't like it.

A yuzuge should definitely be on there, Senren Banka seems to be the most well-rounded and liked one here. Has a variety of heroines to choose from and good balance of romance/comedy/story. Pretty much sets the standard for the genre.
Aokana definitely for it's high production value, art, OST, characters and story.
Fureraba for those looking for a more "dating sim" like VN. Has some pretty good girls and decent comedy. If you don't like high school settings then Making*Lovers or the other Smeege would be a solid choice.
9-nine is great for those that want a little more action and mystery in their stories but still enjoy slice of life and romance.
